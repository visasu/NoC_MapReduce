Error-[UCLI-STOP-UNABLE-SET-STOP-POINT] Unable to set breakpoint
  The setting of line breakpoint in file 
  /afs/asu.edu/users/c/f/a/cfarnsw2/datamining/data_mining/src/mkInputVCQueues.v
  line 387 due to 'stop' command was not successful. 
  Please verify that the 'stop' command arguments are valid and that the 
  statement/enclosing subprogram at file/line is complete and used in the 
  design.  Also verify that the statement on which the BP is being added is in
  a module compiled with line debug capability.  Please recompile using the 
  '-debug_access<+options>' switch and incremental options as required.  
  Recommended options are '-debug_access' for post-process debug, 
  '-debug_access+classdbg' for testbench debug, and '-debug_access+all' for 
  all debug capabilities.  Refer the VCS user guide for more granular options 
  for debug control under the switch '-debug_access' and refer to 
  '-debug_region' for region control.
